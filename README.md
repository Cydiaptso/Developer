# update jailbreak apps/tweaks for roothide
 
 1. install roothide/theos

    ```bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cydiaptso/theos/master/bin/install-theos)"```
    
    and its always automatically updated to latest with original one.

 2. Build package for roothide


    for those simple tweaks that don't use the file api to access jailbreak files, just

    ```make package``` with ```THEOS_PACKAGE_SCHEME=roothide```


 3. Using `roothide` APIs if you need to use the file apis to access jailbreak files in source code
    ```
    #include <roothide.h>
    
    //then using roothide api to access jailbreak files
    
    const char* c_path = jbroot("/path/to/jb/file");
    
    NSString* objc_path = jbroot(@"/path/to/jb/file");
    
    std::string cpp_path = jbroot(std::string("/path/to/jb/file"));
    ```
    ***the `jbroot` API can be used in C/C++/Objective-C/Swift and its fully compatible with building rootful/rootless package***

 4. Add these `entitlements` to your executable/app to make them work correctly with roothide:
    ```
    <key>platform-application</key>
    <true/>
    <key>com.apple.private.security.no-sandbox</key>
    <true/>
    <key>com.apple.private.security.storage.AppBundles</key>
    <true/>
    <key>com.apple.private.security.storage.AppDataContainers</key>
    <true/>
    ```


5. If you want to build your project with Xcode instead of theos,  
   here is the roothide sdk: [devkit.zip](https://github.com/roothide/libroothide/releases/latest)
